---

I'm Junping Li, MS in Marine Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and BE in Automation (EECS) at Ocean University of China. I studied training and application of large models for language, multimodal and agent at Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and cybernetics of cross environment vehicle (CEV) or hybrid aerial underwater vehicle (HAUV) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, such as factor, condition, control strategy and deep reinforcement learning, advised by Prof. Zheng Zeng. During my university years, I was awarded Outstanding Student, Outstanding Graduate, Study First Class Scholarship and Practice Scholarship.

My background covers cybernetics, system and control theory, machine learning, large models, vehicle decision planning, and robotics, I learn and like to learn new knowledge, causal inference, game theory or others. Due to cybernetics and AI, I develop interested in cognition, such as mind, language, behavior, society, and I think a few questions about: human non Bayesian or non scientific cognition but enough natural/effective, rule learning & cognition that we in most cases are based on rules and fuzzy logic with explainable expression, abstract physiology and network compatibility, and cognition embedding/empowerment for something. I hope to combine cybernetics, AI and psychology to propose new ideas, theories and works, and they can be applied to the development of human, society and robotic systems, and make contributions to the world we live in.
