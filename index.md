---

I'm Junping Li, MS in Marine Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and BE in Automation (EECS) at Ocean University of China. I used to study cybernetics of cross domain vehicle (CDV) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Prof. Zheng Zeng. During my university years, I was awarded: Outstanding Student, Outstanding Graduate, Study First Class Scholarship, and Practice Scholarship; I participated in Internet plus Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition and Provincial University Robot Competition, and won the outstanding prize awards.

My background covers cybernetics, system and control theory, machine learning, vehicle dicision planning, robotics, system identification, I learn and enjoy learning new knowledge, causal inference, from CNN/RNN to transformer to multimodal to what, game theory or others. Due to cybernetics and the development of language models, I develop very interested in cognitive science and psychology, such as in mind, language, causality, behavior, society or communication, and hope to combine cybernetics, AI and psychology to propose novel ideas, frameworks and theories, and make the contributions to the world we live in.
