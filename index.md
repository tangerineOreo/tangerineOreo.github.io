---

I'm Junping Li, MS in Marine Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and BE in Automation (EECS) at Ocean University of China. I studied cybernetics of cross environment vehicle (CEV) or hybrid aerial underwater vehicle (HAUV) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, such as factor, condition, control strategy and deep reinforcement learning, advised by Prof. Zheng Zeng. During my university years, I was awarded Outstanding Student, Outstanding Graduate, Study First Class Scholarship and Practice Scholarship.

My background covers cybernetics, system and control theory, machine learning, vehicle dicision planning, and robotics, I learn and enjoy learning new knowledge, causal inference, from CNN/RNN to transformer to what, game theory or others. Due to cybernetics and AI, I develop interested in cognition, such as in mind, language, behavior, or society, and hope to combine cybernetics, AI and psychology to propose new ideas and theories, and they can be applied to the development of human, society and robotic systems, and make contributions to the world we live in.
