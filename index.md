---

I'm Junping Li, MS in Marine Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and BE in Automation (EECS) at Ocean University of China. I used to study cybernetics of cross environment vehicle (CEV) or hybrid aerial underwater vehicle (HAUV) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Prof. Zheng Zeng. During my university years, I was awarded: Outstanding Student, Outstanding Graduate, Study First Class Scholarship, and Practice Scholarship; I participated in Internet plus Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition and Provincial University Robot Competition, and won the outstanding prize awards.

My background covers cybernetics, system and control theory, machine learning, vehicle dicision planning, robotics, and system identification, I learn and enjoy learning new knowledge, causal inference, from CNN/RNN to transformer to multimodal to what, game theory or others. Due to cybernetics and the development of language models, I develop very interested in cognition or psychology, such as in mind, language, causality, behavior, society or communication, and hope to combine cybernetics, AI and psychology to propose novel ideas and theories, and they can be applied to the development of human, society and robotic systems, and make contributions to the world we live in.
